# HelloNetwork

Configures a network and announces itself by SSDP.

You can start this sample and then find your device on the network using the
`cell` tool (see the `nerves_cli_cell` project).

### Limitations

- no tests right now
- no documentation right now
- supports only ipv4ll and DHCP addressing (no interface for static IP yet)
